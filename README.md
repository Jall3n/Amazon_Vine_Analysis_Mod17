# Amazon Vine Analysis
## Purpose

We need to analyze Amazon reviews by members of the paid Amazon Vine program against those who do not pay. There are around 50 datasets to choose from and the one chosen was sports reviews. After choosing the dataset will use PySpark to perform the ETL process and connect it to the AWS RDS instance and load the transformed data into PgAdmin (PostgreSQL). Next, will choose PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favordable reviews from Vine memembers in the dataset.  

## Results

- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

- How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
